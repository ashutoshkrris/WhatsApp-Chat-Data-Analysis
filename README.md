This is a simple data analysis performed on a WhatsApp group chat. Through this analysis, we can answer few questions like :
* Who is the most active person in the group?
* Who is the least active person in the group?
* Whom did I respond the most in the group?
* Which emoji did I use the most?
* How does my WhatsApp usage affect my sleep cycle?
and many more...
